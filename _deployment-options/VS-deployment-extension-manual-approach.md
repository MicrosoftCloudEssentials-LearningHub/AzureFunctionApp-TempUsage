## Function App Hosting Options 

> In the context of Azure Function Apps, a `hosting option refers to the plan you choose to run your function app`. This choice affects how your function app is scaled, the resources available to each function app instance, and the support for advanced functionalities like virtual network connectivity and container support.

> [!TIP]  
>
> - `Scale to Zero`: Indicates whether the service can automatically scale down to zero instances when idle.  
>   - **IDLE** stands for:  
>     - **I** â€“ Inactive  
>     - **D** â€“ During  
>     - **L** â€“ Low  
>     - **E** â€“ Engagement  
>   - In other words, when the application is not actively handling requests or events (it's in a low-activity or paused state).
> - `Scale Behavior`: Describes how the service scales (e.g., `event-driven`, `dedicated`, or `containerized`).  
> - `Virtual Networking`: Whether the service supports integration with virtual networks for secure communication.  
> - `Dedicated Compute & Reserved Cold Start`: Availability of always-on compute to avoid cold starts and ensure low latency.  
> - `Max Scale Out (Instances)`: Maximum number of instances the service can scale out to.  
> - `Example AI Use Cases`: Real-world scenarios where each plan excels.

## Function App: Develop the logic

- You need to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install python from Microsoft store:
    
     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30f00c27-da0d-400f-9b98-817fd3e03b1c">

- Open VSCode, and install some extensions: `python`, and `Azure Tools`.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715449d3-1a36-4764-9b07-99421fb1c834">

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/854aa665-dc2f-4cbf-bae2-2dc0a8ef6e46">

- Click on the `Azure` icon, and `sign in` into your account. Allow the extension `Azure Resources` to sign in using Microsoft, it will open a browser window. After doing so, you will be able to see your subscription and resources.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4824ca1c-4959-4242-95af-ad7273c5530d">

- Under Workspace, click on `Create Function Project`, and choose a path in your local computer to develop your function.

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c42d19e-be8b-48ef-a7e4-8a39989cea5a">

- Choose the language, in this case is `python`:

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fb19a1e-bb2d-47e5-a56e-8dc8a708647a">

- Select the model version, for this example let's use `v2`:
  
   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd46ee93-d788-463d-8b28-dbf2487e9a7f">

- For the python interpreter, let's use the one installed via `Microsoft Store`:

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3605c959-fc59-461f-9e8d-01a6a92004a8">

- Choose a template (e.g., **Blob trigger**) and configure it to trigger on new PDF uploads in your Blob container.

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a4ed541-a693-485c-b6ca-7d5fb55a61d2">

- Provide a function name, like `BlobTriggerContosoPDFInvoicesDocIntelligence`:

   <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/263cef5c-4460-46cb-8899-fb609b191d81">

- Next, it will prompt you for the path of the blob container where you expect the function to be triggered after a file is uploaded. In this case is `pdfinvoices` as was previously created.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7005dc44-ffe2-442b-8373-554b229b3042">

- Click on `Create new local app settings`, and then choose your subscription.

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c211d6-eda0-442b-b428-cdaed2bf12ac">

- Choose `Azure Storage Account for remote storage`, and select one. I'll be using the `invoicecontosostorage`. 

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5865fc-3e84-4582-8f06-cb5675d393f0">

- Then click on `Open in the current window`. You will see something like this:

  <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f30e8e10-0c37-4efc-8158-c83faf22a7d8">

- Now we need to update the function code to extract data from PDFs and store it in Cosmos DB, use this an example:

    > 1. **PDF Upload**: A PDF file is uploaded to the Azure Blob Storage container (`pdfinvoices`).
    > 2. **Trigger Azure Function**: The upload triggers the Azure Function `BlobTriggerContosoPDFLayoutsDocIntelligence`.
    > 3. **Initialize Clients**: Sets up connections to Azure Document Intelligence and Cosmos DB.  
    >    - Initializes the `DocumentAnalysisClient` using the `FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT` and `FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY` environment variables.  
    >    - Initializes the `CosmosClient` using Azure Active Directory (AAD) via `DefaultAzureCredential`.
    > 4. **Read PDF from Blob Storage**: Reads the PDF content from the blob into a byte stream.
    > 5. **Analyze PDF**: Uses Azure Document Intelligence to analyze the layout of the PDF.  
    >    - Calls `begin_analyze_document` with the `prebuilt-layout` model.  
    >    - Waits for the analysis to complete and retrieves the layout result.
    > 6. **Extract Layout Data**: Parses and structures the layout data from the analysis result.  
    >    - Extracts lines, tables, and selection marks from each page.  
    >    - Logs styles (e.g., handwritten content) and organizes data into a structured dictionary.
    > 7. **Save Data to Cosmos DB**: Saves the structured layout data to Cosmos DB.  
    >    - Ensures the database (`ContosoDBDocIntellig`) and container (`Layouts`) exist or creates them.  
    >    - Inserts or updates the layout data using `upsert_item`.
    > 8. **Logging (Process and Errors)**: Logs each step of the process, including success messages and detailed error handling for debugging and monitoring.
